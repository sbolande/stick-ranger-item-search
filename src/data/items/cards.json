        "description": "Allows projectiles to home towards an enemy within the guide length. 'Guide length' refers to the distance between the center of the projectile and its target.\nUnfortunately, most projectiles are close to be as big or even bigger than this, so they'll hit before the homing ability will apply. Because of this, for most weapons, the effect is too small to be really useful. For the Volcano and the Bazooka, the guiding applies only for the projectile, and not the fire or the clouds of the explosion.\nIt's highly recommended just to use this card on piercing weapons like Fire or Laser Gun since this will create an interesting effect. For the Fire Orb and Delta Explosion, the projectile(s) will fly around the enemy, making it useful for flying enemies, but makes it less effective for Trees. For Laser Gun, the projectile pierces through the target and will home in on subsequent enemies.\nIt's also recommended to use this card with slow projectiles rather than fast projectiles, because the guide effect constantly affects projectiles within the guide length over time. The longer a projectile stays in the guide range, the more it is affected. Therefore, the card has very little effect on most fast projectiles, such as Thunder Storm. On the other hand, however, Thunder Spear is a fast projectile that is surprisingly effective with this card. This is mostly due to the fact that the projectiles, when stuck to the ground, will 'Slide' towards enemies in the homing radius.\nThe Atomic Ray is very useful when combined with this card, as it is able to pierce enemies and even bounce off the ground while doing large amounts of damage to groups of enemies or even single enemies.",
